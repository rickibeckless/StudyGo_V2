# WEB103 Project 4 - *StudyGo-v3.2*

Submitted by: **Ricki Beckless**

About this web app: **StudyGo v3 is a web app designed to help users efficiently explore subjects, classes, and units within an educational framework. It utilizes a PostgreSQL database for structured data management, ensuring that all information is well-organized. Built with React, the app provides a straightforward interface that allows users to click on a subject to reveal related classes, and further expand to see associated units. Each detail page has its own unique URL for easy navigation.**

Time spent: **50** hours

## Notes

Building off of the project from Units 1-3, I again modified my approach to the project requirements. The project was based around cars and car customization, and while I neglected the idea of cars I did hold on to the customization features, some of which can be observed on the Events page and others to be implemented on the Units page.
