# WEB103 Project 3 - *StudyGo-v3.0*

Submitted by: **Ricki Beckless**

About this web app: **StudyGo v3 is a web app designed to help users efficiently explore subjects, classes, and units within an educational framework. It utilizes a PostgreSQL database for structured data management, ensuring that all information is well-organized. Built with React, the app provides a straightforward interface that allows users to click on a subject to reveal related classes, and further expand to see associated units. Each detail page has its own unique URL for easy navigation.**

Time spent: **24** hours

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

<!-- Make sure to check off completed functionality below -->

## Notes

While the project requirements and steps utilized events and locations, I opted to build on the same project I've used in Units 1 and 2. The functionality has the same boilerplate of the requirements in that data can be viewed and selected to see further details.
